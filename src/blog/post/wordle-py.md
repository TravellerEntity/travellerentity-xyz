# wordle.py

For this semester's final in AP Computer Science, my team and I had to make a clone of Wordle in Python. This was my first real experience with colored text in the terminal, and I think it turned out pretty well. I also made a custom word list to go along with our program. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/TravellerEntity/wordle). I've included a link in the repo to a website where you can run the code.
