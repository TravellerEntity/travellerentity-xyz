*`I'll preface this whole story with the usual disclaimers. No hate to anyone mentioned (they're just doing their job), school owns the computers and can do what they want, no school principals or IT guys were harmed in the making of this blog post, yada yada. You get the picture. With that out of the way, like so many students before me, let me tell you why...`*

# Web filters suck

...and I hate everything they do, and the geniuses who decided to force them on my district of thousands of students! Yes, I know CIPA exists, and I know the woefully underfunded American school system is basically forced to comply if they want to continue receiving certain benefits from the government. BUT, there's still no reason why the filtering solutions they choose have to go out of their way to get so... *in the way* of a normal web browsing experience! In fact, the most annoying part of this is that nothing would be wrong if schools actually used their filters properly! So let me back up for a second and explain, to the best of my ability, my problem with Securly and its web-filtering brethren.

In the US, schools like mine are required to filter inappropriate websites on computers that will be used by students to receive money from the government. They *are* basically holding valuable funding hostage from schools, but out of all the "ransoms" they could demand to release the money, ensuring kids are protected on the internet sounds like a fair trade to me. It must have sounded that way to the district too, as I have yet to find a single computer without filtering software installed in all the years I've been in my district. Here's the problem, though, and it begins to rear its head as you try to use the internet like a normal person. Let me present you with a story that might help.

It's the end of your last class of the day. "That's all for today," your teacher announces. "There's still 15 minutes left, though, so you can work on stuff for other classes now. And if you're done with that - read, talk, play games, whatever! I don't care as long as it's quiet." *Sweet!* you think to yourself. So you head over to your favorite game site, looking forward to some quality, uninterrupted enter--

Blocked! *Darn, I guess IT finally caught on*, you think. You go to Spotify this time. Maybe you can catch up on your favorite artist's new album while you have the ti--

Blocked again?! This is getting ridiculous! *Let's just go to GitHub,* you think. You've got a new app you've been working on, and there's enough time to finish it right now. You'll show your friends, it'll be--

***GOD DAMN IT!!*** You slam your computer shut in a huff and spend the rest of class wondering what you're supposed to do with your life if the school won't even let you on a website *specifically designed* for creative people who want to make cool things.

And therein lies the largest problem. No matter who manages the web filters or which school district you're at, one thing remains the same -- they never, *never* just block what they're supposed to. Somehow they always manage to be the most overzealous, infuriating beasts you've ever been subjected to. You might as well just not use your school computer if you're cut off from such large swaths of the internet. I thought this would change when I arrived in high school, but no. Maybe your experience is different (and I sincerely hope it is), but with many of my teachers, you literally can't use your phone in class, not even during "free time". It's the Chromebook way or the highway if you want internet access.

There are even more problems with web filtering at my school. First and foremost, we have not one, not two, *not even three* filters in use - we have *four freaking web filters in our district!* Securly, Cisco, Hapara, and some crappy unbranded DNS-based filter, are all watching our computers every second of every day! Not only is this an industrial-scale invasion of privacy, it also massively slows down our aging school laptops. Could admin really not see what they were about to unleash on their students *before* they blew tax dollars on the ingredients to this toxic cocktail?

Not to mention, the developers of every single filter currently in use here are *completely braindead!* It's been absolutely hilarious to watch enormous communities of pissed-off students and motivated programmers collaborate across the internet to poke, prod, and break every single major filter currently in use wide open. I'd like to give special recognition to Securly, which has proved so broken and useless that I've counted at least four unique critical exploits discovered by members of the community (not me) that completely disable the extension's CORE FUNCTIONALITY! These were open and actively spreading around the internet for anyone to use for weeks, sometimes *months at a time* (!) before the devs finally got around to patching their freaking extension! Put on your tinfoil hats, because I'm convinced that they don't care in the slightest about protecting the students who depend on them - they just want to pocket whatever fees schools pay for access and drag their feet until they're forced to take action. I feel sorry for any school willingly paying for this garbage, and even worse for any who think that it's actually doing what it says on the tin.

Honestly, I don't even know how to end this rant off. I have so many issues with Securly, and all the other major web filters in use across the country. They started out as normal, necessary software, but have since blossomed into an industry of bloated, spaghetti-coded, all-around broken extensions whose continued existence is a waste of time and money for school districts and a massive annoyance for students who are subjected to them. It's a constant cat-and-mouse game of students discovering new ways to get their freedom back, if only for a moment, and schools wasting time trying to close the gaping loopholes in their filters. I don't think filters should go, but there needs to be a serious discussion between students and school administrators about how over-restrictive web filtering is in this day and age. We need to tame this web-filtering beast somehow!
