Hey everyone! There's a library card design contest going on right now, and so far I'm the only one who has submitted one. Three winners will be selected, and each of them will get an actual plastic library card with their design on it! If you want to enter, head to the library, grab a sheet from beside the counter, and follow the instructions. Be quick, though - submissions close October 11.
